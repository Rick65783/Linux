                                                        Basic commands, File managment

User Management/ Administration:-
---------------------------------
		1. Local user management ==> if you create any user inside a system is called a local user..
		2. Centralized user management ==> Active Directory (windows) / Open Ldap (Linux) ==> ldap protocol (this will be maintained by the AD team)
 			Honda ==> Dev, Testing systems, prod systems
					5000+ systems 
						sai ==> I need to create the user in these 5000+ servers
						mohith ==>

			we link up AD server with all these 5000+ servers...
					sai ==> create a user in the AD then he will be able to login in all these 5000+ serrver 
						whenever you delete the user in the AD the user will not be able to login in these servers..

create user, modify user, delete user, set password, etc....


       servers: why we will build servers?

		to develop application, to supply data from application, to maintain data in the server

ICICI net banking applicatio, HDFC net banking appllication, amazon.com, flipkart.com, sbi net banking


   application devel , application support team, DB team, infra team ( OS,network,backup,Storage, Dc team).

      Infra team support:  server build(OS installation), disk management, User management, network setup in OS.

	 20 Members team, for 20 memebers we have to create individual account.
	also to run application we need to create common user
	      to run db need one local/common user

-----------------------------------------------------------------
    Local user management:

    	user name : Max 32 char
	uid : 
		0 = root
		1 - 99 = OS users(system users)lib,bin,.....
		100 - 999 = id are reserved for third party application/tool users(tomcat,apache,nfs,.....)
		1000 - 60000 = local users or general users

database : postgres, mysql, oracle, db2, ...........
applicaitons ==> jboss, galssfish, jetty, websphere, weblogic........


sai : 99


linuxgroup ==> seconday group 
sai ===> sai (primary group)
  group:
	1. Primary group
	2. secondary group
  home directory : /home/narasimha  /home/venu
  shells : /bin/sh ,/bin/bash, /bin/dash,/bin/csh , /bin/tcsh & /bin/nologin, /sbin/nologin

cat /etc/shells

/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/sh
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/tcsh
/bin/csh
--------------------
what is user name?
what is shell
what is home directory
what is userid


-------------------------------------------

 simple command: 
	useradd venu

=------------------------------
what are the files will get modified when you create a new user?

/etc/passwd ==> all users information 
	
ghouse:x:1003:1003:linux user:/home/ghouse:/bin/bash
gangulaiah:x:1004:1004:devops user:/home/gangulaiah:/bin/bash

1: username
2: pointing to /etc/shadow file for password informaton
3: Uid
4: primary group id
5: comment
6: home directory
7: shell 


/etc/shadow ==> this will have all the password information..

ghouse:$6$GmBLLtfm$0OPrsJPWWx.99w/kNlxGdJRiBkHyr7ParCMvQ9IlZV4pkg28i4oPGlf1YdjZLdpQIxPZ2ryfqRzwAgmpDgrQX/:19384:0:90:7:::

84rd day

gangulaiah:!!:19384:0:99999:7:::

1. Username
2. encrypted password
3. password changes days count from jan-1-1970
4. min age of password  0 days
5. max age of password  . password is going to expair
6. warning age of password : war 10 exp 30 from 20 days onwards it will give warning message on screen while login . 
         user your password is going to expair in 10
``
		next 
7. inactive days for password after password expaires   10 days. 30 but still password will be in active for another 10.
				30 + 10 40 he can't change password after 40 days.
			
		
8. account expairy days

/etc/group ==> this will have groups information including primary group and secondary group 
/etc/gshadow ==> this will have group passwords information..

And it will create the home directory
	/home/ghouse
	/home/gangulaiah 

And it will create environment files in the home directory. These files are user specific files, for each user in the system these files willbe present..
these are local variable envornment files for a specific user...
	.bash_profile ==> local variables we can put here, it will get loaded at the time of login ==> su - username 
				here "-" means, the .bash_profile file will get loaded...
	.bashrc => local variables we can put here, this will be called automatically by .bash_profile
	.bash_logout ==> it's the place where can we can put the commands to be run at the time of logout..		
		at the time of logout of a user, if you want to perform something, you can put commands here....	
	.bash_history ==> it will store history of commands ran by the user..

where can we see the global environment variables/ system variable means common for all users in the system?
	/etc/profile
----------------------------------------
without using useradd/adduser command, how to create a user?
you need to create an entry in 
	/etc/passwd
	/etc/shadow
	/etc/group
	/etc/gshadow
	create home directory or you can make home directory using usermod command...
---------------------------------------
how to login to a user?
	su - username
how to exit from a user login?
	exit
	logout
	ctrl+d


-------------------------------------------------------------------
how to set or reset the password for a user ?
	passwd username

how to set or re set the password for a user group?
	gshadow groupname

----------------------
password locked  ==> we can unlock
password expired ==> we can reset the passowrd using passwd command 
account locked ==> we can unlock the account
account expired ==> it can not be access, if require, we may need to create a new user or we can extend the account expiry days..
-----------------------------------------

Creating user with specifications:
	useradd -u 2000 -G 0 -d /opt/venugopal -m -c "Venu G" -s /bin/bash venu


	u = UID
	g = Primary group
	G = Secondary group
	d = Home directory path
	m = Make home directory
	c = comment
	s = shell for user

-----------------------------------------
for example if you want to create 10 users and assign those users with /bin/csh shell 
	useradd -s /bin/csh testuser1

but there is way to specify home directory and shell..

default homedirectory and shell will be in the 
/etc/default/useradd file

     useradd prasad2

   each and every user will have one primary group and the users can be member into n number of groups
  1 primary and he can member into n number of groups



 group will create along with user
	useradd appuser
	   there will app group also

  	for appuser primary group is appuser

	useradd -g appuser -G root appuser1
		username = appuser1
		pr gr = appuser
		se gr = root
   	        appuser group is shared between appuser and appuser1

1: username
2: pointing to /etc/shadow file for password informaton
3: Uid
4: primary group id
5: comment
6: home directory
7: shell 


/etc/default/useradd 
this file is going feed the missing informtion to useradd command

/etc/default/useradd file will feed the specification if we haven't specified in useradd command.



how to specify /bin/dash shell for all upcoming users?
useradd -s /bin/dash username
ans : in this case we can update default shell in /etc/default/useradd

already 100 users created with /bin/bash by mistake , here how we can change /bin/bash to /bin/dash shell for these 100 users?

in this case /etc/default/useradd file will not help to change default shell information for existing users.



useradd -u 5000 -G unixgrp -d /usr/local/apache -m -c "apache user" -s /bin/sh apachetomcat



password information will be there in /etc/shadow

narasimha:encrypted password:18949:2:99:7:10:300


there will be 8 fields

5. max age of password  . password is going to expair
6. warning age of password : war 10 exp 30 from 20 days onwards it will give warning message on screen while login . 
         user your password is going to expair in 10
		your password is going to expair in 9 days
		next 
7. inactive days for password after password expaires   10 days. 30 but still password will be in active for another 10.
				30 + 10 40 he can't change password after 40 days.
			
		
8. account expairy days




date aug 20 2020
  if i say today your contract will expair after one year. what is this mean today aug 20 2021

tomorrow also if i say your   


    max 60

for narasimha we changed password today.    oct 20

usermod -g existinggroup username


expairy is 30
  18494  
   21-08-2020 today we changed password

passwd -S narasimha

how we can change password age
   passwd -n 3 -x 90 -w 10 narasimha

	-n : min age of password
	-x : max age of your password
	-w : warning days of password expairy

lock the password of specified user:    passwd -l narasimha
unlock the password of specified user : passwd -u narasimha

  passwd -x 100 narasimha
  passwd -x -1 narasimha  : password shoud never expair

   min : n
   max : x
   war : w


   chage -l narasimha
	chage -M 200 narasimha
	-M : uper case M is for set Maximum age of password
	-m : small is for set min age of password  passwd -n 3 username but in chage . chage -m 4 narasimha

	chage -M -1 narasimha
	or
	passwd -x -1 narasimha
password should not expair


how to lock the account?
	usermod -L sai
how to unlock the account?
	usermod -U sai
passord lock 
	passwd -l sai
	passwd -u sai


how we can identify is the password is locked?
	/etc/shadow in this file second field if we can see !! before encryption password means password is locked
	/etc/shadow in this file second field if we can see ! before encryption password means account is locked
	/etc/shadow in this file second field if we can see only !! without any encryption data means no password set


create group
	groupadd appteam
	groupadd oraclegrp
with the specifications creating group
	groupadd -g 5000 oraclegrp

How to delete user only not home directory?
	userdel username
How to delete user with home directory?
	userdel -r username

How to delete group?
	groupdel oragrp

which are files will get updated once account creates?
	1. /etc/passwd
	2. /etc/shadow
	3. /etc/group


awk command is for print the data in colum vise from output/file.

How to print Only normal users not system users?

How to change password max age to 90 days to users which are having password age more than 90 days

awk -F: '{if ($5 > 90) print $1}' /etc/shadow > /tmp/narasimhafile
 
suppose there are 1000 users which are having password age is more than 90

chage -M 90 user1
chage -m 90 user2

for i in `cat /tmp/narasimhafile`
do
chage -M 90 $i
done



if [ condition1 && condition2 ];


   create user
	mod user
	delete user
	what is group
	1. Primary
	2. secondary
	create group
	modify group
	adding members into group

what is variable?
 there are 2 types variables
	1. System variables 
	2.User defined variables


system variables are predefined variables. functionality or values already stored by operating system developer.

user defined variables: end user will define or store the values in variable.

for system variables you can't change the functionality but we can control the variable with help of options.
 

How to list out System variables?
	env

How to change system variable value temp?

     export SYSTEMVARIABLENAME=
	export HISTSIZE=3000
how to set system varaable value perm?
	step1:update the new value in /etc/profile
		HISTSIZE=3000
	step 2: manually refresh the environment configuration file.
		source /etc/profile


How to set variable temp?

		  udf :    a=10
	    	  system : export HISTSIZE=4000
		unset a
		unset HISTSIZE

 

difference between 3 quotes
	"  "
	'  '
	`  `  you can fine below of esc key


" "  is for print the value what we defining



   Global environment configuration files    : /etc/profile, /etc/bashrc
   Individual environment configuration files: .bash_profile,.bashrc,.bash_logout .
	 individual env files we can find in home directories of individual users home directory.


By default 3 files will be copied to your user as soon as creates user.
	1. .bash_profile
	2. .bashrc
	3. .bash_logout
next login onwards one more file will create in his home directory
	4. .bash_history

by default above 4 files will present in home directory of all the users, include root.
   skeliton

global variables we will set in /etc/profile or /etc/bashrcles 

individual variables we will set in his own files /home/username/.bashrc and .bash_profile

========================================================================================


How to create multiple users at a time.
step 1 : create a file with usernames
	vi /tmp/users
		user1
		user2
		user3
		user4
		user5
step 2 : run below for loop to create users
	for i in `cat /tmp/users`
		do
		useradd $i
		done

How to set password for multiple users?
step 1 : create a file with usernames
	vi /tmp/users
		user1
		user2
		user3
		user4
		user5
step 2 : run below for loop to set same password for all users?
	for i in `cat/tmp/users`
		do
		echo "$i:test12345"|chpasswd
		done

how to set password in single time without retype same password?

  actually when we try passwd username
	it expects two times same password to set password

echo "username:test1234567"|chpasswd
