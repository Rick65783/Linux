YUM (yellowdog update modifier)

yum list installed = rpm -qa

yum list install vsftpd = rpm -qa vsftpd

yum install pkgPath= rpm -ivh packagePath

yum remove pkgname   = rpm -evh pkgname
yum info pkgname     = rpm -qi pkgname
yum reinstall pkgname.rpm  = rpm -ivh pkgname.rpm --force
yum upgrade pkgname.rpm = rpm -Uvh pkgname
yum downgrade pkgname.rpm = rpm -Uvh --oldpackage pkgname

yum update ==> to update complete system..

root or if you have sudo privilages then also normal can install softwares but default only root can install/unistall



the main difference between rpm and YUM is repository. we can create repository usng YUM.

How to create local repository?
	step1: Mount the dvd and install pre-requisite packages
		mount /dev/sr0 /media
		rpm -ivh /media/Packages/deltarpm
		rpm -ivh /media/Packages/python-deltarpm
		rpm -ivh /media/Packages/createrepo
		rpm -ivh /media/Packages/vsftpd
	step 2: create local directory to store all packages
		mkdir /var/ftp/pub/rhel7.5
	step 3: copy packages from dvd to newly created directory in step 2.
		cp -r /media/Packages/* /var/ftp/pub/rhel7.5/
	step 4: create repository
		createrepo -v /var/ftp/pub/rhel7.5
	step 5: configure the local repository
		cd /etc/yum.repos.d
		vi local.repo
		  [rhel75.repo]
		  name=rhel75.repo
		  baseurl=file:///var/ftp/pub/rhel7.5
		  gpgcheck=0
		  enabled=1
	step 6:	refresh the repositories
		yum clean all
	now repository is read with 7.5 packages.
how to list out configured repositories
	yum repolist

------------------------------------------------------------------
SERVER SIDE:
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl disable firewalld
setenforce 0
systemctl start vsftpd
systemctl enable vsftpd

make sure IP address is there in yum repo server

CLIENT SIDE:
	How to integrate client machine with yum repo server

Step 1:make sure there is network connectivity between client machine to yum repository server
	ping yumserverip
	ping 192.168.40.101
    with the ping command we are able to confirm there is route to destination or target machine.

	server side we have enabled vsftpd service to transffer data or supply data to client machines.
	 make sure client machine is connecting to yum server through 21 port number.
		telnet 192.168.40.101 21

	ftp  selected ftp
	http 80
	ssh 22
to comeout from the telnet command
ctrl + }
quit

step 2: configure the local repository 
	cd /etc/yum.repos.d
		vi local.repo
		  [rhel75.repo]
		  name=rhel75.repo
		  baseurl=ftp://192.168.40.101/pub/rhel7.5
		  gpgcheck=0
		  enabled=1

step 3: refresh the repositories
	yum clean all
step 4: list out the repositories
	yum repolist

------------------------------------------

YUM server creation
Yum client creation...

7.6 ==> 7.9 ==> copy all the packages and create repository... you can update the system to 7.9
--------------------------

       rhel 7.5 == or > your current version
repository 7.2? there will any use of this repository

we should have subscription to update the RHEL system..


yum local server and client

org

satelite server and client

  *  How to integrate client machine with satelite server
	step 1: make sure katello-agent package is installed
	step 2: register server
	client: subscription-manager register --username narasimha --password test12345
           subscription-manager register --org="test" --activationkey="key"
 * How to check client machine status with satelite server.

		in client machine execute below command to get client status

			subscription-manager status
		or
		http://satelitehostname.test.com
			username:
			password:
		Dashboard ==> Hosts ==> content hosts  here you should find your servername with green.


* Scenario 1: How to perform patching

	every 6 months redhat will release new kernel with minor changes.
note: make sure scheduled server is integrated with satelite server.

   process : change co-ordinatator will follow up with client for appoval.
*********************************************************************************************************************
step 1 : we have change management team who will get approval from client for patching servers. we will procced further with patching activities once approval in place.
	step 2 : create snapshot before patching activity.(Vmware team)
	step 3 : collect prechecks from server  (uname -r;uname -a;cat /etc/os-release;df -hT;cat /etc/fstab;pvs;vgs;lvs)
	step 4 : disable alerts for scheduled servers. (Monitoring tool)
	step 5 : request server owner to stop the application to procced with patching.
	step 6 : perform sanity reboot before patching.
	step 7 : perform patching if server is up
			yum update    ==> full patch
			yum update kernel ==> only kernel update
            yum update --exclude=kernel*
                How do I exclude kernel or other packages from getting updated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux while updating system via yum?
                    https://access.redhat.com/solutions/10185
			yum update --security  ==> update only security patches
		how to check are there any security updates
		yum list-security
		  or
		yum --security check-update
	step 8 : reboot server
			shutdown -r now
	step 9 :  we will do post checks and hand over server to owner of the server.
	step 10 : enable the alerts once app team confirms application is working fine.


Roll back: Any one of these
	solution 1:  merge the snapshot patching activity.
	solution 2:  Boot with old kernel   grub2-set-default 2
	solution 3:  undo the patching activity

		
		change: main change who is the owner of main change( change co-ordinator)
			task: 1 Unix team for patching (Unix team)
			task: 2 application team (application team)
			task: 3 vmware team to take snapshot if you don't have access to take snapshot ( vmware)
			task: 4 backup team for backup the full machine (backup team)

how to change default kernel?
  the following command is for list out installed kernels:  
	awk -F\' '$1=="menuentry " {print $2}' /etc/grub2.cfg
Want to set default kernel as 2 or previous one.
	grub2-set-default 2
	shutdown -r now


how to list out yum related activities?
	yum history
how to get information about yum activity?
	yum history info 3
how to revert the yum activity?
	yum history undo 3


       roll back


step 1 : make sure repository is ready with old packages in yum server. eg: 7.6
step 2 : client should point out to 7.6 repository.
step 3 : client should boot with old kernel
		awk -F\' '$1=="menuentry " {print $2}' /etc/grub2.cfg
		grub2-set-default 2
		shutdown -r now
step 4 : rename the protect command
	mv /etc/yum/protected.d/systemd.conf /etc/yum/protected.d/systemd.conf.bkp
step 5 : revert the patch
	  yum history undo 2 


     physical machine pre-requisites:
	console credentials
	make sure we are able to login to console
	virtual machine:
	make sure you have vcentre access

	disk info(lsblk)
	lsblk;df -hP; cat /etc/fstab; uname -a;pvs;vgs;lvs


* what is the difference between yum update and yum upgrade?
	yum update : preserves the old data
	yum upgrade : it upgrades(over writes) the old data
	which is default functionality if we execute yum update
	   the default is update
yum configuraton file is /etc/yum.conf

* How to install packages from specific repository?
 
	server side: 7.5   192.168.40.101 /var/ftp/pub/rhel7.5
		     7.0   192.168.40.101 /var/ftp/pub/rhel7.0

	client side: 7.5
		     7.0

			ping looks fine
			telnet looks fine
		vi /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo
			[rhel70.repo]
			name=rhel70.repo
			baseurl=ftp://192.168.40.101/pub/rhel7.0
			gpgcheck=0
			enabled=1
			[rhel75.repo]
			name=rhel75.repo
			baseurl=ftp://192.168.40.101/pub/rhel7.5
			gpgcheck=0
			enabled=1

yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="rhel70.repo" install vsftpd

yum install vsftpd




while roll back which one should be enable?

	client side: 7.5
		     7.0

			ping looks fine
			telnet looks fine
		vi /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo
			[rhel76.repo]
			name=rhel76.repo
			baseurl=ftp://192.168.40.101/pub/rhel7.6
			gpgcheck=0
			enabled=1
			[rhel79.repo]
			name=rhel79.repo
			baseurl=ftp://192.168.40.101/pub/rhel7.9
			gpgcheck=0
			enabled=0
	

* How to enable specified repository if you have satelite server?
	subscription-manager repos --list
    subscription-manager status
	subscription-manager --enable=repository id  
		repository id is nothing but old repository(7.0)

How to update new packages in yum repository?
	eg: 4000
	along with that i want to add few more
	cp ah-stepstone-1.11-1.el6.x86_64.rpm /var/ftp/pub/rhel7.5/
	createrepo --update /var/ftp/pub/rhel7.5/


 
* what is the difference between rpm and yum?

==> both are inbuilt package management tools for redhat servers.
==> the difference is repository. the repository can possible through the yum.
	the advantages of yum is
		it automatically consider dependancies.
		easy to perform patching(update from one version to other version)



install one of the package in 100 servers?
	step 1 : create file with 100 servers IP
		vi /tmp/servers
			192.168.40.10
			192.168.40.11
			192.168.40.12

	step 2: for i in `cat /tmp/severs`
		do
		ssh $i "yum install pkgname -y"
		done

actual command:	ssh 192.168.40.10 "yum intall pkgname -y"
