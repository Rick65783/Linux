================================= @SSH ==========================
SSH (Secure shell)
	pkg = openssh
	service = sshd
	daemon= sshd
	port = 22
	configuration file : /etc/ssh/sshd_config

data will travel in encryption format.

Adv:
1. Data travel in secure manner with help of encryption mechanisum.
2. we can transfer files and directories through ssh service.
3. using ssh full administration can possible in remote machine.

	ssh 192.168.40.101
	ssh -l narasimha 192.168.40.101
	ssh narasimha@192.168.40.101

cp -r file /tmp/
i am in 100 machine and pushing /testdir directory to 101 machine.
scp -r /testdir narasimha@192.168.40.101:/tmp/

we can pull from 101 machine
scp -r narasimha@192.168.40.100:/tdir /home/narasimha/

rsync -avhz anaconda-ks.cfg root@192.168.92.131:/root/sai

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
transferring /testdir directory data to 101 machine , it's copying by narasimha user in /tmp path.


scenario 1:
 Disable root login through ssh service.

Unix team:15 every required root credentials are not?
	      yes

directly they will start login to server as a root
lvremove applv

	who deleted lv?
	  root


disable : ssh root@192.168.40.101 
accepted : ssh narasimha@192.168.40.101
	   su - root
	in this case there will log in /var/log/secure file
	narasimha opened session as a root

	tail -50 /var/log/secure


	vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	# PermitRootLogin yes
	change it to 
	PermitRootLogin no
restart the sshd service to reflect the recent changes
	systemctl restart sshd

	

out of 15 users today 15 users logged in server but only 5 users switched to root.

How to change ssh port number?

22
Step 1 : change port number in configuration file.
	vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	#Port 22
	change to 
	Port 2222
step 2: update the new port number in /etc/services file
	ssh             22/tcp                          # The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol
	ssh             22/udp                          # The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol


change it to 
	ssh             2222/tcp                          # The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol
	ssh             2222/udp                          # The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol

step 3 : restart the ssh service
	systemctl restar sshd


step 4 : disable the firewall
	 systemctl stop firewalld
	systemctl disable firewalld

How to deny normal users and groups through ssh service?

add below parameter in following file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	
	DenyUsers  narasimha test sai gangulaiah
	DenyGroups groupname

	AllowUsers
	AllowGroups

	restart the sshd service to reflect above change
	systemctl restart sshd

	OR
	you can also set the shell 
	/bin/nologin
	/sbin/nologin

eg : oracle will have common user that is oracle. 
	this oracle user is for start and stop the database in this every database administrator required oracle user password.


10 database servers
in all 10 machines there will be oracle user and it required all db administartors.


How to set Banner message for ssh login users?
step1:update banner file path in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
		#Banner none
		change it to
		# Banner /etc/mybanner
step 2: create banner file	
create /etc/mybanner
	Welcome to server
step 3: restart the service
systemctl restart sshd


machine1                 machine2

username & password

creating trust relation between 2 machines.


machine1 [nfsserver]192.168.40.100
client [clientm1] 192.168.40.101
created user in both the machines
	useradd bkpuser

going to create trust relation from nfsserver to clientm1
 bkpuser can login from nfsserver to clientm1 without password.

nfsserver server user has to share public key with clientm1 then only client will trust and allow him without password.

    for each and every user will have 2 keys 1. Private 2. public.
	
s1 to s2
pub ==> in S2
s2 to s1
s2 pub ==> in S1

PASSWORDLESS AUTHENTICATION
------------------------------------------------

step 1: generate keys 
	ssh-keygen
note: make sure you logged in as bkpuser or respective user and generate keys.

step 2: share public key with clientm1 machine(192.168.40.101).
	ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub bkpuser@192.168.40.101
  please be in keys located place and execute above command.
	/home/bkpuser/.ssh/

	make sure 700 permissions on .ssh folder
	make sure 600 permissions on .ssh/authorized_keys file


Usecase:there is one script in clientm1 and it should trigger every day at 11:30 PM. 
	note: this script should be execute by nfsserver user.

usecase: clientm1 data needs to copy in nfsserver everyday at 11:40 PM.
  machine: nfsserver
		scp -r bkpuser@192.168.40.101:/data /bkp/clientm1/
 	
	40 23  * * * scp -r bkpuser@192.168.40.101:/data /bkp/clientm1/

by default 10 ssh connections can possible. how to increase ssh connections?
	/etc/ssh/sshd_config
	#MaxSessions 10
	change it to 
	MaxSessions 100
	systemctl restart sshd

==============================================================================================
		Difference between TCP/UDP
	1. TCP (data)
	2. UDP (data)
	3. ICMP (ping)


ftp in binary format ==> TCP
ssh ==> TCP
NTP ==> UDP
DNS ==> UDP

  TCP(Transmision control protocol)
  UDP(User datagram protocol)


 TCP								UDP
It's connection oriented protocol			It's connection less protocol

Header:								Sorce IP and port
source IP& port
Destination IP & port						destination ip & port
	sequence number
	acknowledgement number
	flag
	urgent pointer

Header size is 20 Bytes						8 Bytes
TCP is slow if we compare with UDP				Performance will be too good.
delivery							no gauranty
packet retry is possible					No retry facility
packets are very secure						no security for packets
it follows seq order						no seq order
error segments							no error segment


easy to hack
	ftp data (20/21) 20= data 21 = connection
	ssh data (22)
	nfs  data (2049)
	samba data (137,138,139)
	http data (80)
	rsync data (22)
	ntp date and time (123)
	dns hostname and IP (53)

================================== @NFS ===============================================

			NFS
		Network File system

File system will be in network for access remote machines.

pkg: nfs-utils
port: 2049
service:nfs
Daemon:nfsd,mountd,nfslogd,lockd,statd
config file: /etc/nfsmount.conf

Versions : 2,3,4
current version is 4
RHEL 5 & 6 the default version was 3
RHEL 7 & 8 the default version is 4
		sshd
		vsftpd

nfsd:this is the main daemon of nfs, responsible to export file system and make sure applyning permissions. 
Mountd: responsible to take care mount requests from client machines.
nfslogd: it captures nfs clients and server related activities and write in /var/log/messages.
lockd:
statd:


	exporting file system in nfs server
	step 1 : make sure nfs-utils package is installed
	step 2 : identify the file system and grant full permissions to others
		eg: /sharedata
		chmod o+rwx /sharedata
step 3 : export the file system
		vi /etc/exports
		/sharedata *(rw,sync)

	step 4 : start or restart the service
		systemctl restart nfs

		systemctl enable nfs
 disable firewalld
	systemctl stop firewalld
	systemctl disable firewalld

how to list out exported file systems in server
	exportfs

client machine:
	step 1 : make sure there is network between client machine and server
		ping 192.168.40.100
		telnet 192.168.40.100 2049
	note: move ahead with next steps if there is network and connection through 2049 port.
	step 2 : create local directory and mount network share.
		mkdir /sharedata
		mount 192.168.40.100:/sharedata /sharedata
	echo "192.168.40.100:/sharedata  /sharedata   nfs     defaults        0 0 " >> /etc/fstab

how to list out shared file systems/drives in remote machine?
	showmount -e 192.168.40.100 
	


	/sharedata *(rw,sync)   ==> everyone
 	/sharedata 192.168.40.*(rw,sync)  ==> only to 192.168.40. network
	/sharedata 192.168.*.*(rw,sync)  ==> granting access to all c class network
	/sharedata 192.168.40.103(rw,sync) ==> only to one machine
	/sharedata 192.168.40.104(ro,async)

* what is the difference between sync and async?
sync: writting data from client to server.
4 GB data
transferring from client to server
after successful copy data to server then server will give confirmation to client machine like data recieved.
sync is waiting to complete and give confirmation to client machine. 

async : async will confirm imediatly to client machine data recieved .
he will not wait until data copy. starting itself async will give confirmation to client.

* sync or async which one will improve the nfs perfomance?
	Async
