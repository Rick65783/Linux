/

/ is a parent directory
 inside this parent directory we will have 13 default important directories.

Windows 
    C: ==> windows, programs files, program files(X86), ....
    
   1. /boot ==> All bootable files 
    booting ==> start ====>login prompt
   2. /root ==> Root user home directory 
    root user itself an administrator user
        windows ==> Administrator user
   3. /home ==> ALl normal user home directories by default
        jagadeesh ==> /home/jagadeesh
        ghouse    ==> /home/ghouse
        gangulaiah ==> /home/gangulaiah
        aparna     ==> /home/aparna
        mohit       ==> /home/mohit
        
   4. /etc   ==> All system configuration files
        /etc/passwd ==> all users information
        /etc/shadow => all users password information..
        /etc/group  ==> all user groups information...
   5. /var ==> Variable Analysis Report...
            All system logs
            /var/log/messages
            /var/log/sa/sa01,sa02,sa3.........
   6. /usr
    UNIX SYSTEM RESOURCES
        Means libraries and commands/binaries.....
        /usr/bin ==> normal user binaries/commands
        /usr/sbin ==> Super user binaries/commands (root user)
            /usr/sbin/useradd
            /usr/sbin/usermod
        ==> all these sbin commands will be executed by ROOT user only by default
        /usr/lib ==> all system libraries
        /usr/lib64 ==> all system 64 bit libraries...
        
   7. /sbin(/usr/sbin)
    shortcut dir
   8. /bin(/usr/bin)
    shortcut dir
   9. /lib (/urs/lib), 
        /lib64 (/usr/lib64)
   
   10. /proc ==> All system processing information..
    ALL CURRENT SYSTEM RUNNING INFO
    
    Cpu information     ==> /proc/cpuinfo
    mêmeory information ==> /proc/meminfo
    swap information ==> /proc/swaps
    each process information ==>/proc/PID/.....
    
    what is mêmeory?
        Active pages in the memory is called RAM
    what is swap mêmeory?
        Inactive pages in the mêmeory is called swap
    
    HDD ==>         RAM ==> CPU
    5GB ==> SWAP => 2GB ==> CPU
    
   11. /dev ==> ALL THE device information
    /dev/sda
    /dev/sdb
    /dev/sdc
    /dev/terminals....
    
   12. /mnt ==> Guest partition..
   13. /tmp ==-> Temporary directory, we use this file system for backup purpose
    sai ==> file1 ==> complete access
    jagadeesh ==> file2 ==> complete access

    whoever keeps the file into the /tmp directory... he will become owner of that file... others will have only read access..
    This is called Sticky bit permission....
    
14. /media => cd/dvd
15. /opt ==> Optional file system
    we can install third party softwares....
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. /boot : contains the OS bootable files, these files helps to load your operating system.(eg: kernel files).


 clear = to clear the screen (ctl+l)

alt+F2

2. /root : it's a home directory of administrator.who is the administrator in Linux/Unix root user.
        no other user can enter into root user home directory.
       
   window: c:/users/admin
			Desktop,Downloads, Documents.....

	   c:/users/narasimha
			Desktop,Downloads,Documents......
3. /home  :  contains other users home directories. this is the default location for other users.

4. /etc  : it contains configuration files of operating system and third party tools/softwares configuration files.
5. /var  :  it contains activity report or log(activity report) of system activities.
   /var/log i deleted everything from /var/log . is operating sytem will come up? yes
     unfortunatly deleted /boot directory data. is operating system will cme up? no
6. /usr;  Unix system resources
      it contains oprerating system binaries(programs) like commands(ls,cd,cp,rm,useradd,userdel)

  ls  command
  cd  command
  pwd command
  rm   command
                 /usr/bin ( common commands for all users commands)
                 /usr/sbin (super(root) user commands)

		useraddministration commands : sbin
    		 useradd,userdel,usermod

		software managment:   sbin
		install,uninstall,upgrade

		ls,cd,pwd    =  bin



7.  /bin  : few commands are seperated from /usr/bin to /bin location. these commands will help during OS boot up.
8.  /sbin : few commands are seperated from /usr/sbin to /sbin directory or location. these commands will help during os boot up.
9.  /lib  : it contains libraries of operating system. these libraries(programs) are shared between multiple commands or binraries.
   libraries are important to run your programs or operating system.
     /boot = important to load operating system
     /lib  = imp to load operating system
10. /proc  :  it a temp directory for processor. this directory used by processor(cpu). it stores data of process or task.
11. /dev  :  It contains logical device names( cd/DVD, hard disk, RAM,).
12. /mnt   : guest directory . we can store any data here
13. /tmp  : it contains every user running processes data.
