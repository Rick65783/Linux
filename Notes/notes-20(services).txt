SElinux
Secured enhanced Linux

FTP ==> 10 users in the sytesm
only 2 users should use this FTP service
or 
only few options should be enabled..

firewall is a service. It does the packet filtering. in and out packets filtering.

firewall ==> physical  = It will be under network team control. Network team will write in/out rules.
firewall ==> OS service = is a individual machine security service.

 90 % organizations will not maintain os level firewall.


firewall will do the packet filtering which port is trying to connect? is that port is accepted or not? this part will be take care by firewall.

selnux: 

suse = by default doen't have the selinux
red hat = it has selinux by default.

ftp: /var/ftp and user home directory.


			SElinux modes
			1. enforcing : is recommended
			2. permissive
			3. disable

configuration file: /etc/selinux/config
	How to change SElinux mode permanetly?
	step 1 : update mode in configuration file
		vi /etc/selinux/config
			SELINUX=permissive
	step 2 : reboot the server
		shutdown -r now

how to change selinux mode temp?
	setenforce 1
		enforcing
	setenforce 0
	permissive
1= enforcing
0= permissive

how to switch on particular selinux rule?
	setsebool -P samba_enable_home_dirs on
how to list out all the selinux rules
	getsebool -a 
how to list out only samba service selinux rules?
	getsebool -a | grep samba


setsebool -P ftpd_use_cifs on

Service starting/stopping/restarting/enable/disable/status

systemctl in RHEL7

systemctl start servicename ==> to start the service
systemctl stop servicename ==> stopping the service
systemctl restart servicename ==> to restart the service which is already in started state
systemctl status servicename => just to check the service status to know whether started or not..

systemctl start servicename
systemctl enable servicename => even after restarting the machine, the service will get started automatically..

systemctl stop serviceame 
systemctl disable servicename ==> it will be  disabled and will not activate again after restart..


service in RHEL6

service servicename start/stop/status/disable/enable/restart

all are for transffer data from one to other machine.


route test : ping
service test in destination machine : telnet or nc

yum install nc



* what is the difference between Telnet and NC?
	Telnet : possible to send data through telnet
	NC : not possible to send data through nc because it supports only 0 packets.
	telnet : will not support for UDP protocol services. It can't test the UDP service status in destination machine.
	nc : net cat can test both the services TCP/UDP.

* which service recommended?
	nc
	because hackers can not transfer or inject any program to server.

nc -vz <destinationip> <portnumber>
	v = verbose
	z = zero packets transfer
nc -uvz <destinationIP> <portnumber>
	U = UDP
	v = verbose
	z = zero packets

nc -uvz 192.168.40.121 123

   Traceroute:
 
trace the route


telnet or nc you may will connection refused ? how to trobleshoot where is the issue?
 in destination machine we will check service status. in destination machine service is running but still source couldn't able to connect destination.

    4. port number : 20/21
    5. Daemon : vsftpd

    back ground running service or process.
    front end is service
    back end is daemon
    if you stop service even daemon will get stopped.
    if you start service even daemon will run.


       > FTP is for transfer files from one machine to other machine.
       Adv:
        1.  FTP is very fast,stable,efficient service.
        2.  we can transfer data through internet.
            we can access server through browser and command line
     Draw back:
        1. we can transfer only files not possible to transfer directories.
        2. FTP use the Binary format to transfer data over network.
            very easy hack data if data travelling in binary format, it's security bottleneck.

	systemctl restart vsftpd

in browser : ftp://192.168.40.100
cmd : ftp 192.168.40.100

By default all the users are allowed except root user for FTP service.

how to provide ftp access to root user?
remove root user name in the /etc/vsftpd/ftpusers file
How to deny normal user?
add username in /etc/vsftpd/ftpsers file


useradd siva

how to deny all the users and allow specific users?

================================= @SSH ==========================
SSH (Secure shell)
	pkg = openssh
	service = sshd
	daemon= sshd
	port = 22
	configuration file : /etc/ssh/sshd_config

data will travel in encryption format.

Adv:
1. Data travel in secure manner with help of encryption mechanisum.
2. we can transfer files and directories through ssh service.
3. using ssh full administration can possible in remote machine.

	ssh 192.168.40.101
	ssh -l narasimha 192.168.40.101
	ssh narasimha@192.168.40.101

cp -r file /tmp/
i am in 100 machine and pushing /testdir directory to 101 machine.
scp -r /testdir narasimha@192.168.40.101:/tmp/

we can pull from 101 machine
scp -r narasimha@192.168.40.100:/tdir /home/narasimha/

rsync -avhz anaconda-ks.cfg root@192.168.92.131:/root/sai

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
transferring /testdir directory data to 101 machine , it's copying by narasimha user in /tmp path.


scenario 1:
 Disable root login through ssh service.

Unix team:15 every required root credentials are not?
	      yes

directly they will start login to server as a root
lvremove applv

	who deleted lv?
	  root


disable : ssh root@192.168.40.101 
accepted : ssh narasimha@192.168.40.101
	   su - root
	in this case there will log in /var/log/secure file
	narasimha opened session as a root

	tail -50 /var/log/secure


	vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	# PermitRootLogin yes
	change it to 
	PermitRootLogin no
restart the sshd service to reflect the recent changes
	systemctl restart sshd

	

out of 15 users today 15 users logged in server but only 5 users switched to root.

How to change ssh port number?

22
Step 1 : change port number in configuration file.
	vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	#Port 22
	change to 
	Port 2222
step 2: update the new port number in /etc/services file
	ssh             22/tcp                          # The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol
	ssh             22/udp                          # The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol


change it to 
	ssh             2222/tcp                          # The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol
	ssh             2222/udp                          # The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol

step 3 : restart the ssh service
	systemctl restar sshd


step 4 : disable the firewall
	 systemctl stop firewalld
	systemctl disable firewalld

How to deny normal users and groups through ssh service?

add below parameter in following file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	
	DenyUsers  narasimha test sai gangulaiah
	DenyGroups groupname

	AllowUsers
	AllowGroups

	restart the sshd service to reflect above change
	systemctl restart sshd

	OR
	you can also set the shell 
	/bin/nologin
	/sbin/nologin

eg : oracle will have common user that is oracle. 
	this oracle user is for start and stop the database in this every database administrator required oracle user password.


10 database servers
in all 10 machines there will be oracle user and it required all db administartors.


How to set Banner message for ssh login users?
step1:update banner file path in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
		#Banner none
		change it to
		# Banner /etc/mybanner
step 2: create banner file	
create /etc/mybanner
	Welcome to server
step 3: restart the service
systemctl restart sshd


machine1                 machine2

username & password

creating trust relation between 2 machines.


machine1 [nfsserver]192.168.40.100
client [clientm1] 192.168.40.101
created user in both the machines
	useradd bkpuser

going to create trust relation from nfsserver to clientm1
 bkpuser can login from nfsserver to clientm1 without password.

nfsserver server user has to share public key with clientm1 then only client will trust and allow him without password.

    for each and every user will have 2 keys 1. Private 2. public.
	
s1 to s2
pub ==> in S2
s2 to s1
s2 pub ==> in S1

PASSWORDLESS AUTHENTICATION
------------------------------------------------

step 1: generate keys 
	ssh-keygen
note: make sure you logged in as bkpuser or respective user and generate keys.

step 2: share public key with clientm1 machine(192.168.40.101).
	ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub bkpuser@192.168.40.101
  please be in keys located place and execute above command.
	/home/bkpuser/.ssh/

	make sure 700 permissions on .ssh folder
	make sure 600 permissions on .ssh/authorized_keys file


Usecase:there is one script in clientm1 and it should trigger every day at 11:30 PM. 
	note: this script should be execute by nfsserver user.

usecase: clientm1 data needs to copy in nfsserver everyday at 11:40 PM.
  machine: nfsserver
		scp -r bkpuser@192.168.40.101:/data /bkp/clientm1/
 	
	40 23  * * * scp -r bkpuser@192.168.40.101:/data /bkp/clientm1/

by default 10 ssh connections can possible. how to increase ssh connections?
	/etc/ssh/sshd_config
	#MaxSessions 10
	change it to 
	MaxSessions 100
	systemctl restart sshd

==============================================================================================
		Difference between TCP/UDP
	1. TCP (data)
	2. UDP (data)
	3. ICMP (ping)


ftp in binary format ==> TCP
ssh ==> TCP
NTP ==> UDP
DNS ==> UDP

  TCP(Transmision control protocol)
  UDP(User datagram protocol)


 TCP								UDP
It's connection oriented protocol			It's connection less protocol

Header:								Sorce IP and port
source IP& port
Destination IP & port						destination ip & port
	sequence number
	acknowledgement number
	flag
	urgent pointer

Header size is 20 Bytes						8 Bytes
TCP is slow if we compare with UDP				Performance will be too good.
delivery							no gauranty
packet retry is possible					No retry facility
packets are very secure						no security for packets
it follows seq order						no seq order
error segments							no error segment


easy to hack
	ftp data (20/21) 20= data 21 = connection
	ssh data (22)
	nfs  data (2049)
	samba data (137,138,139)
	http data (80)
	rsync data (22)
	ntp date and time (123)
	dns hostname and IP (53)

================================== @NFS ===============================================

			NFS
		Network File system

File system will be in network for access remote machines.

pkg: nfs-utils
port: 2049
service:nfs
Daemon:nfsd,mountd,nfslogd,lockd,statd
config file: /etc/nfsmount.conf

Versions : 2,3,4
current version is 4
RHEL 5 & 6 the default version was 3
RHEL 7 & 8 the default version is 4
		sshd
		vsftpd

nfsd:this is the main daemon of nfs, responsible to export file system and make sure applyning permissions. 
Mountd: responsible to take care mount requests from client machines.
nfslogd: it captures nfs clients and server related activities and write in /var/log/messages.
lockd:
statd:


	exporting file system in nfs server
	step 1 : make sure nfs-utils package is installed
	step 2 : identify the file system and grant full permissions to others
		eg: /sharedata
		chmod o+rwx /sharedata
step 3 : export the file system
		vi /etc/exports
		/sharedata *(rw,sync)

	step 4 : start or restart the service
		systemctl restart nfs

		systemctl enable nfs
 disable firewalld
	systemctl stop firewalld
	systemctl disable firewalld

how to list out exported file systems in server
	exportfs

client machine:
	step 1 : make sure there is network between client machine and server
		ping 192.168.40.100
		telnet 192.168.40.100 2049
	note: move ahead with next steps if there is network and connection through 2049 port.
	step 2 : create local directory and mount network share.
		mkdir /sharedata
		mount 192.168.40.100:/sharedata /sharedata
	echo "192.168.40.100:/sharedata  /sharedata   nfs     defaults        0 0 " >> /etc/fstab

how to list out shared file systems/drives in remote machine?
	showmount -e 192.168.40.100 
	


	/sharedata *(rw,sync)   ==> everyone
 	/sharedata 192.168.40.*(rw,sync)  ==> only to 192.168.40. network
	/sharedata 192.168.*.*(rw,sync)  ==> granting access to all c class network
	/sharedata 192.168.40.103(rw,sync) ==> only to one machine
	/sharedata 192.168.40.104(ro,async)

* what is the difference between sync and async?
sync: writting data from client to server.
4 GB data
transferring from client to server
after successful copy data to server then server will give confirmation to client machine like data recieved.
sync is waiting to complete and give confirmation to client machine. 

async : async will confirm imediatly to client machine data recieved .
he will not wait until data copy. starting itself async will give confirmation to client.

* sync or async which one will improve the nfs perfomance?
	Async

========================================================================	

@SAMBA

nfs: Unix to unix
we can share file system between Unix platform to unix platform.

unix to windows
unix to unix


		

the unique future of samba is we can export file system across cross platforms(unix to windows and windows to Unix)
		Pkg: Samba and cifs-utils
		ports : Unix 137,138,139  ( Unix to windows)
			windows : 445 ( windows to Unix)
		service : smb
		daemon : smbd
		config file : /etc/samba/smb.conf


Scenario 1 : export file system in windows and accessing it in Linux box.

	exportfs 
to know the exported file system in windows
	\\localhost
how to know the IP address in windows?
	ipconfig /all


step 1 : share the file system in windows
	rc on directory and share with ==> specific people
step 2 : login to Linux box and do the connectivity test.
	  ping windowsIP
	  telnet windowsIP 445
step 3 : create Local directory and mount windows file system with local directory.
		mkdir /soft

Scenario 2 : export file system in Linux and access it in Windows box?

step 1 : make sure samba and cifs-utils pakcages are installed
	  yum install samba cifs-utils


step 2 : Decide which file system we are going export and make sure other have full permissions on it
		mkdir /winshare
		chmod o+rwx /winshare
step 3 : export it
	vi /etc/samba/smb.conf
	
[narasimhashare]
path = /winshare
browseable = yes
writable = yes
write list = narasimha


save and come out and then validate the syntax mistakes
	testparm

restart the smb service
sytemctl restart smb
systemctl enable smb
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl disable firewalld


cifs = common internet file system

make sure narasimha id is present in server and added that user into smb list
	id narasimha
	smbpasswd -a narasimha
	below command is for list out samba users
	pdbedit -L
	
	remove user from samba list
	smbpasswd -x sree
	disable user temp
	smbpasswd -d sree
	enable user
	smbpasswd -e sree
	



selinux  =======> with in system
firewalld =====>outside


below command is for disable se linux temp
	setenforce 0


how to mount it in windows?
	open my computer
	right click on free place ==> add a network location ==> \\192.168.40.100\narasimhashare

@NTP
			Network time protocol

NTP service is for supply date and time to client machines. 
sessions will get expair if we maintain stand alone date and time to individual machine because development team sets the session expairy and time out for sessions.

must and should we have to maintain seperate NTP server and make sure all clients are integrated with NTP server to sync up latest date & time.


Task 1 : configure NTP server
	pkg : ntp
	service : ntpd
	daemon  : ntpd
	port    : 123/UDP
	config file : /etc/ntp.conf

step 1 : install latest ntp package
step 2 : customize ntp settings
	vi /etc/ntp.conf
	# Hosts on local network are less restricted.
change 1:	restrict 192.168.40.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap
change 2: 	server 127.127.1.0
		fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 2
step 3 : start the ntp service
	systemctl restart ntpd
	systemctl enable ntpd
note: make sure firewalld service is stopped
validate is ntp is working.
ntpq -np

client side:

step 1 : install latest ntp package
step 2 : customize configuration file
	remove existng server lines and add our internal server ip
		server 192.168.40.100 prefer

step 3 : restart ntpd service
	systemctl restart ntpd
	systemctl enable ntpd

ntpq -np



offset is actual round trip difference between ntp server and client


chrony:
introduced from RHEL 7 onwards. it can recovery offset value automatically between client to ntp server.
pkg : chrony
service : chronyd
daemon: chronyd
port : 123/udp
config file: /etc/chrony.conf


to get the ntp status
chronyc tracking  = ntpstat 
how to get ntp server details?
chronyc sources
how to get latest date and time from the ntp server manually?
chronyd -q "192.168.40.100"

* what is TTL?

newly added records will get activated after expairing TTL time.
eg: 17-11-2020 at 7:20 AM one new record has been added into forward lookup zone, suppose TTL time is 1 Day then this newly added record will activate after 24 hours. 
  it will get activated at 18-11-2020 at 7:20 AM onwards.

to reflect newly added records imediatly.
    systemctl restart named
      or
    decrease TTL time  and restart named service to reflect this ttl time.
	systemctl restart named


  primary DNS server or master DNS server

  Slave DNS sever

SOA :  here we will maintain master dns server resources and slave replication details.




domain name : b22.com

FQDN : nfsserver.b22.com.
fully qualified domain name

  
refresh: between DNS master server to slave server if slave is there.
retry : 6 AM retry has happened, next retry will happen at 8 AM but failed at 8 AM.

test.b22.com
t.b22.com

note: make sure we have assigned static IP for DNS server


step 1 : create forward lookup zone and update entries 
$TTL 600
@       IN SOA  nfsserver.b22.com. root.b22.com. (
                                2020111702      ; serial
                                        2h    ; refresh
                                        1h    ; retry
                                        2d  ; expire

                allow-query     {any; };
                file "fwdb22";
        };

step 3 : verify syntax of config file and zone file
	configuration file : named-checkconf /etc/named.conf
	zone file : named-checkzone b22.com /var/named/fwdb22

step 4 : restart the named service to reflect new dns server.
	systemctl restart named
	systemctl enable named
 note : make sure firewall is disabled




how to integrate client machine with DNS server?
 in client machine just update dns server details in /etc/resolv.conf file
	search b22.com
	nameserver 192.168.40.100




* how to find out your dns server details?
