HOW TO GET THE UMASK VALUE?
	umask
HOW TO CHANGE THE UMASK VALUE?
	umask umaskvalue
HOW TO CHANGE THE UMASK VALUE FOR THE USER AT THE TIME OF LOGIN?
	you need to provide an entry in the .bash_profile OR .bashrc


umask value:
	ROOT=> 0022
	NORMAL USER UMASK VALUE => 0002
ROOT USER
DIR ==> 777-UMASK = 0777-0022 = 755 
FILE==> 666-UMASK = 0666-0022 = 644

drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root    6 Feb 12 11:57 dir123
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root    0 Feb 12 11:56 file123

NORMAL USER
DIR ==> 777-UMASK = 0777-0002 = 775 
FILE==> 666-UMASK = 0666-0002 = 664

---------------------------
* what is umask? could you please explain about umask?
		     
 umask is a controller in default permissions. 
	eg: per one user or for all the users if you want to apply default permissions then we can modify the umask number.

root user umask is 	: 022
other users umask is 	: 002



			dir 777
			file 666

				777	666
	root			022	022
				---	---
				755	644

------------------------------------------------------

				777	666	
				002	002	
	Others			---	---	
				775	664

how to get current umask value?
	umask
	umask 000



what is default umask for root and system users : 022
what is default umask for other users  		: 002
=====
chmod is for change permissions on file/directory, this command can be execute by any of the user.
chown is for change owner ship on file /directory, this command will work only for root user.

    file owner narasimha he can change permissions but not ownership.

chmod is which catogory command bin/sbin? bin
chown is which catogory command bin/sbin? sbin


chown venu /file22
chown venu:groupname /file22
chgrp groupname /file22

chown -R venu /dir

it change the ownership from /dir to n number depths inside /dir to venu

/dir/testdir

  testdir owner was narasimha

after executing below command it change the ownership to venu
	chown -R venu /dir



* what is inode?
  the inode is a data structure for file and directory.

    owner,permissions, file creation date and time, sectors, file size in blocks, file access time, links

========
Special Permissions 
				1. ACL (access control list)
                    Think of a scenario in which a particular user is not a member of group created by you but still you want to give some read or write access, how can you do it without making user a member of group, here comes in picture Access Control Lists, ACL helps us to do this trick.
				2. Sticky Bit
           3. SetUID
                    This bit is present for files which have executable permissions. The setuid bit simply indicates that when running the executable, it will set its permissions to that of the user who created it (owner), instead of setting it to the user who launched it. Similarly, there is a setgid bit which does the same for the gid.
           4. SetGID
	               
ACL:
---------
group
user


-r--r--r--. 1 sai linuxgroup 0 Feb 12 12:05 f1

	chown gangulaiah f1


		normal permission
		chmod and chown
		
ls -ld file1
	-rwxrwxr-x 2 narasimha   narasimha  4096  oct 10 file1

	owner  : narasimha
	group  : narasimha
	others : other than narasimha and narasimha group members comes under others category.

	raja ==> secondary group is narasimha
	sree ==> secondary group is unix
	venkat ===> secondary group is narasimha

teja for we want to provide full permissions,how we can fullfill this requirement?
	chmod 777 file1
		u= owner
		g= group
		o=others
		there is not individual username option
	we can provide permissions to individual users.

	setfacl -R -m u:gangulaiah:rwx /HRdata/finance
		setfacl -R -m u:sai:rwx /HRdata/finance

	mkdir -p /HRdata/finance
	chmoe 700 /HRdata/finance
	useradd rahul
	groupadd hrteam
	chown -R rahul:hrteam /HRdata/finance
	useradd sree
	useradd narasimha
	gpasswd -M narasimha,sree unix
