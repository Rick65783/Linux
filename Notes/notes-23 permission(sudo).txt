Special Permissions 
				1. ACL (access control list)
                    Think of a scenario in which a particular user is not a member of group created by you but still you want to give some read or write access, how can you do it without making user a member of group, here comes in picture Access Control Lists, ACL helps us to do this trick.
				2. Sticky Bit
                3. SetUID
                    This bit is present for files which have executable permissions. The setuid bit simply indicates that when running the executable, it will set its permissions to that of the user who created it (owner), instead of setting it to the user who launched it. Similarly, there is a setgid bit which does the same for the gid.
                4. SetGID
	               


		normal permission
		chmod and chown
		
ls -ld file1
	-rwxrwxr-x 2 narasimha   narasimha  4096  oct 10 file1

	owner  : narasimha
	group  : narasimha
	others : other than narasimha and narasimha group members comes under others category.

	raja ==> secondary group is narasimha
	sree ==> secondary group is unix
	venkat ===> secondary group is narasimha

teja for we want to provide full permissions,how we can fullfill this requirement?
	chmod 777 file1
		u= owner
		g= group
		o=others
		there is not individual username option
	we can provide permissions to individual users.

	setfacl -R -m u:teja:rwx /HRdata/finance

	mkdir -p /HRdata/finance
	chmoe 700 /HRdata/finance
	useradd rahul
	groupadd hrteam
	chown -R rahul:hrteam /HRdata/finance
	useradd sree
	useradd narasimha
	gpasswd -M narasimha,sree unix
how to provide read and execution permissions to unix group.
	setfacl -R -m g:unix:r-x /HRdata/finance
how to list out acl permissions
	getfacl /HRdata/finance
how to provide full access to raja
	setfacl -R -m u:raja:rwx /HRdata/finance
How to exclude permissions to one paticular user?
	setfacl -R -x u:teja /HRdata/finance
how to remove all acl permissions?
	setfacl -b /HRdata/finance


how to grant rwx permissions to ramu and provide r-x permissions to hr group
	setfacl -R -m u:ramu:rwx,g:hr:r-x /HRdata/finance

==============================================================================================
	2. Sticky bit

	/data
requirement is every one has to use this /data directory but each other should not delete other users data.
	narasimha
	sree
	raja

dir ==> sticky bit permission
 
/tmp is the default directory where sticky bit applied.. this directroy used for back up purpose66
	narasimha ==> copy, create,.. he become as a owner and primary group of that file others will have only read access
	sree
	raja
	
	mkdir /data
	chmod -R 777 /data
	chmod +t /data
	or
	chmod -R 1777 /data
how to remove sticky bit
	chmod -t /data
	or
	chmod -R 0777 /data

		0 = no special permissions
		chmod 0777 /data
by default on which directory sticky bit applied?
	/tmp

		1 = sticky bit
		chmod 1777 /data

drwxr-x--- 2  rahul hrteam  4096  aug 20 /HRdata
setfacl -R -m u:teja:rwx /HRdata

	getfacl /HRdata
setfacl -m u:raja:rwx /testfile
setfacl -R -m u:ramu:r-- /dir


==================================================================
sudo

	root
		user administration
		disk management
		OS installation
		software management
		exporting file system through nfs/samba
		any services configuration


database users
	systemctl
application
	systemctl start/stop/restart/disable/enable servicename


normal user can not run /usr/sbin command by default.. in this case, if you want to allow specific binaries/commans OR full permissin for the normal user, we should go for Sudoers permissions..

oracle team: during installing oracle software in Linux they need administartor access.
   		we will share root password with them.
		this policy volution.

   Passwd@12345698

only in that particular machine set simple passswrod and share with oracle team with proper approval.
      root@123

using sudo we can grant sudper user commands(sbin) access to the normal users.

		vi /etc/sudoers
		or
		visudo

root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
narasimha  ALL=NOPASSWD:   ALL

username  hostname= effective user   commands

narasimha,sree,raja   testmachine=narasimha  /usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/sbin/usermod

how to list out sudo privilages of normal user?
	sudo -l


root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
sree,narasimha  ALL=NOPASSWD:   /usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/sbin/userdel, /usr/sbin/u
sermod
oracle ALL=NOPASSWD:   ALL
narasimha ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/su - oracle
sree ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/su - root


how to provide sudo privilages to 100 users?
  create group and add 100 users into group and provide sudo privilages to group.


 %groupname   ALL=(ALL)  /bin/su - oracle
 %unixgrp     ALL=(ALL)  /bin/su - oracle

what is command alias and user alias?


Cmnd_Alias MYADMINCOMMANDS = command1, command2, command3, command4, command5, command6,command7, command8, command9
Cmnd_Alias APPCOMMANDS = command1, command2, command3, command4, command5, command6,command7, command8

provide above commands set to 3 users

narasimha  ALL=NOPASSWD:  MYADMINCOMMANDS
sree    ALL=NOPASSWD:  MYADMINCOMMANDS,APPCOMMANDS 
%unixgrp ALL=NOPASSWD: MYADMINCOMMANDS,APPCOMMANDS


User_Alias ADMINS = narasimha, raja, sree, test, venu, gangulaiah 

ADMINS  ALL=NOPASSWD: MYADMINCOMMANDS,APPCOMMANDS
