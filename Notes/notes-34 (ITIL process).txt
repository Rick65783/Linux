ITIL 





-----------------------------------------------------------------


ITIL 

			Information technology infrastructure library


infrastrucure:
Hardware(servers): Mounting server in RACK,OS installation, network setup
OS administration: OS administration
Network: firewall, routes, switches and Load balancer.....
Storage : storage management
Backup : backup management
OS level support
------------------------------------
I am unable to login to abcd0101 host
	ITIL 
		ticket
------------------------------

ITIL : it describes processes, prodcedures, tasks and checklists.
we can deliver quality service.
we can avoid downtime of customer application


	IT companies
	   ==> Development
	   ==> Delivering IT services
1. Development: product based companies
	oracle, IBM, HP, rubrik, pega systems,redhat,suse,facebook,what'sup,google
2. Delivering IT services:
	they will deal with other companies and provide IT services
	mainly provide infrastrucre services to client.

	TCS,ACCENTURE,INFOSYS,HCL,IBM,Capgemini,CTS, DXC,myntri...............


sevice provider/vendor: who is providing services to client
client : who is giving work to service provider

    campbell,DANA,IKEA,ADM,TKS  == product based companies
   ACCENT:  Build, migrate servers, setup application and hand over servers to them.
currently theair infrastrucure running in VMWARE or physical . they want to shift infrastructure to cloud

durration : 1 Year
amount : 
aggrement : this aggrement happens between client and vendor. we call this aggrement as a SLA. 

	SLA = service level aggrement

Ticketing tools

	Main components of ITIL
	1. Change management ( ticketing tool)(CR) process is integrated inside Ticketing tool
	2. Incident management(ticketing tool)
			application is not responding 
			system is not responding to commands
			HIGH CPU
			HIGH memeory usage

	3. Problem management (ticketing tool)

------------------------------------------------

ITSM: IT service management



project : started by Reliaence - client
development : HCL - service
		application:
		10 teams are working for single project
		
IT services : Accenture - service
		OS operations team
		platform team
		Storage team
		Backup team
		Network team

  	
	operations : Os level support we will provide to clients
	  it may be 24X7.
	to provide 24/7 we will create 3 shifts. A shift , B shift and C shift
					A shift  or morning shift- India 6 AM- 3 PM = 9 h
					B shift or afternoon shift- UK  2 to 11 PM   =  9 h
					C shift or night shift - US 10 PM to 7 AM     = 9 h
									 ====

transfering the tickets from one shift to another is called "Handover call"


									 27 h
							1 gap between first shift to second is for hand over first shift  things/tasks to second shift team.
							if full team not in in place then they schedule 30 min meeting to have proper shift hand over.
	
shift allownance point also they will include in SLA
in each shift how many engineers will be there to provide service and included in SLA.
   night shift
	2 L1
	2 L2
	1 L3
  L1 Support = level 1 : < 3
  L2 Support = level 2 : 3 to 6 years
  L3 Support = level 3 :  6 to 9 Years
	Vendor ==> OS Vendor

   conference call: L1 and L2 along them client also will participate. 


		1 . Change management
		    there are 3 types of changes
			1. Routine change management
			2. Standard change management
			3. emergency change management

if we modify any thing on infrasture that change we will consider as a change management and follow the Change process to perform that change
	 
		scheduling job
		creating partition
		installing package
		un-installing package
		patching
		user delete
		upgrade any package
		customizing kernel paramenters

	routine : quarterly once we have to perform patching
		1. patching
		2. BIOS upgradation 
		3. CMOS battery for servers - yearly once we will replace it
	standard:
	create new partiton
	extending partition space
	removing partition
	installing/un-installing/upgrading packages
	user creation/deletion
	scheduling jobs in cron
	providing sudo privilages
	exporting nfs share
	configure ftp server
	upgrading RAM/CPU/HDD

	emergency :
	   routine and standard both changes any time considered as a emergency 

standard and routine follows the change process.
 change process time is 10 day



      RFC ==> CEP ==> TAB ==> CAB ==> go or no go call ==> implement ==> validate ==>success ==> close CR
								 ==> Faild ==> 


everything should complete with in change window time only.

RFC = request for change
CEP = change execution plan
TAB = technical advisory board
CAB = Change advisory board : in cab meeting following teams will be involved delivery managers and implementor. Implementor will explain about CR and look for approval. delivery managers will review CR and give approval.

sme  = subject matter expert
L1,l2,l3, L4 or SME

patching : infra team. OS administrator
RAM :   app server = application team will request
	db = db team will request
  extend the cpu's  = if db team ask then here db team is a RFC team

linux administrator

extend ram. requested by application team
change management team : these are guys are supervisors for change. 
   CR =change request in ticketing tool
   RFC : app team
change manager will request to VMWARE team to prepare CEP . 


CAB = every week thur at 9 PM

for CR tab compleded on friday. for this CR when will be next CAB meeting.


2. Incident management(ticketing tool)
   sever is not responding to commands
	server performance has been degraded
	User or users unable to login to server
	users unable to access nfs share drive
	could not able to use any of partition
	could not able to use file or directory
	network connectivity issues.
	application is not accessible
	High CPU utiliztion
	high memory utiliztion
	partition is full


ticketing tool: sm(service manager), remedy, Snow(service now), Jira, jabbix

ticketing tool is nothing but tracking system, where we will track Changes,incidents,Service requests and problems.

	 Incident
	service request

    2 Ways you will get incidents
	1. user manually he will open incident
	2. Monitoring tool will create incident
	monitoring tool keep monitors your system, it opens ticket as soon as it noticed any obnormality.like high cpu usage, high memory usage, any service stopped, partition full
       monitoring tool creates ticket in ticketing tool.


     / partition is in warning stage 80  priority 3
   production server is down P1
  applicaiton is not working in production envronment P1

Env:
Production: which is the environment generating revenue for company.
DR
QA
DEV  
stagging/Lab 

SLA

P1: if there is bussiness/revenue impact then consider that incident as a P1.   we have to submit RCA ( root cause of analyze). here we have join in P1 call. we have to be call and fix the issue.
   Incident manager: he open bridge/conference meeting will all respective team to fix the issue.
	
P2: doen't required RCA

	
P1 = if there is business impact then we will consider that incident as P1.

P1/S1 = Critical
P2/S2 = High priority
P3/S3 = Mediam
P4/S4 = Low

Operations team or run team: 24/7 support

incident manager: incident management DL
change changer : changemanagement DL

How to handle P1:   Acknowledge ticket ==> intimate to incident management team ==> join in incident management call

Unix team /application/DB/Indident manager will be in call

every 30 incident manager will take updates from you and send incident notification mail to all stakeholders.
	issue : server is down 
	impact : so so business is not accessible
	owner of the incident  : unix team
	what time incident started : 10:30 PM IST
	progress description : unix team identified some issue with hardware and try disable one CPU and bring up the server. 

production server is down : P1
dev server is down : P2
QA server is down : P2

production server is down but still application is running: P2
	Silo1   Silo2
	Web1  web2
	app1   app2
	DB1     DB2


SR : service request
  CR
  IC
 SR = service requests
	reset my password
	provide sudo access
	provide access to one of the file or directory
	add me into group
	extend the partition space
	grant crontab access

ticket Handle : new/open ==> ack and in-progress ==> pending for approval
				               ==> resolve ==> close
				               ==> resolve ==> In-progress

problem management:

where we don't have permanent solution for incidents that kind of incidents we will treat as problems.

we can expect solution from SME or OS vendor.
to fix one problem we may open or implement multiple CR.
even vendor not sure on issue so they offer multiple solutions in this sitution we might execute multiple CRs.
there 4 solution
cr 1 solution 1 no luck
then
CR 2 solution 2 no luck
then
CR 3 Solution 3 fixed


    CR
    IC
    PR

How to open case with Redhat vendor?
Support.redhat.com or access.redhat.com
 user name: company email address
 password: **********


How to co-ordinate with hardware vendor for any part replacement.
	HDD
	RAM- DIMM(dual in-line memory module)
	CMOS battery
	processor
	SMPS
	HBA= Host bus adaptor


  ILO  = HP servers
  IDRAC = IBM
  IBM = RSA (remote supervise adaptor)

call ==> share the serial number of server
they caller will verify the server is under warranty or not
if server is in warranty then he open case for incident

        caller will ask server location, DC, Address of DC and Gatepass


to replace DIMM or HBA card is CR required?   yes
based on CR approve and window time the hardware engineer will visit your DC and replace the part.
   
             backup
            prechecks
	disable alerts
	stop the application
	stop the server
	request hardware engineer to replace the part
	engineer will power on the server after part replacement
	post validation
	start the application
	confirm


DC request is mandatory to allow hardware engineer inside DC.

below information is mandatory 
	hardware engineer name
	hardware engineer pan/any of the proof 
	windows time 
	rack number
	sever name and tag

along with hardware engineer one security will walk with him.
